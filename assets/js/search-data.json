    "content": "So with the above building blocks i.e. half adder and full adder discussed in Combinational Analysis, lets construct a simple ALU that performs a arithmetic operation (1 bit addition) and does 3 logical operations namely AND, NOR and XOR as shown below. The multiplexer selects only one operation at a time. The operation selected depends on the selection lines of the multiplexer as shown in the truth table. Input = M0,M1 &amp; Output = Operation . | M0 | M1 | Operation | . | 0 | 0 | SUM | . | 0 | 1 | AND | . | 1 | 0 | OR | . | 1 | 1 | XOR | . Now you can take up the 1 bit ALU as block and construct a 4 bit ALU, which performs all the functions of the 1 bit ALU on the 4 bit inputs. Thus a single building block can be constructed and used recursively. The inputs A and B are four bits and the output is 4 bit as well. Figure below illustrates it: . There are a few important takeaways here: . | The selection lines MO and M1 select the function ALU performs. These selection lines combined with the input arguments and desired functions, an Instruction Set can be formed. | These Instructions can used to create meaningful programs. Since these are required to be easily available, they can be stored on ROM unit. | The input arguments A and B are often stored in Internal Registers. These along with other special purpose register form the registers of the microcontroller. | ROM memories are slower in speed, hence an intermediate high speed RAM is often used. | All the critical timings, decoding of the instructions are often grouped together in seperate control and timings unit. | If a Micro controller would be constructed only from ALU, RAM and ROM, there would not be any external interface. Hence, you now have Input/Output (I/O) ports. | Additional features such as Interrupts, communication protocols, EEPROM, Timers/Counters, Debug interfaces etc. are incorporated to make a controller complete. | . In above discussion you might have left out intricate details involved in an ALU, CPU design. But the aim was to understand ALU/CPU at a deeper level. ",

Functions of 1 variable . Any logic function of a single variable $f(x)$ can be represented by a line: . Cube representing a logic function with one variable. The points at both ends of the line indicate the values that the variable $x$ can take (0 or 1). Functions of 2 variables . In a similar way a function of two variables can be represented by a square in a two-dimensional space: . Cube representing a logic function with two variables. In the figure it is easy to see that (1,0) and (0,1) are not adjacent, while (1,1) and (0,1) are adjacent. Functions of 3 variables and more . This representation can be further extended to higher orders. For instance, a function with three variables would be represented by the following three-dimensional cube: . Cube representing a logic function with three variables. Again, the adjacencies can be identified by the lines connecting the corners of the cube.

Check out the binary representation of a decimal number (the numbers used for counting i.e., from 0-9) in binary. Example: Decimal Number :: 25 Binary Number :: 11001 . ",

Follow the steps below: . | STEP 1: Write the decimal value of each digit on top of them respectively. The value which you seek to write is 2(place value from right) beginning from 0 i.e., 20, 21, 22 …. continuing up to 27. | STEP 2: Now, multiply each digit of binary number with its value. | STEP 3: Add ‘em all. | STEP 4: Result is ready :) | . Note: If the number is large, increase bits of the binary number on the left. Keep in mind that it’s value will increase subsequently. Example :: Decimal number :: 25 You can convert the 1st, 4th, and the 5th digit from the right by tapping on it to convert from 0 to 1. Further, the respective binary digit is multiplied with the value present on top of each digit. Now add.

Note: We can construct any digital circuit with the help of only two gates namely AND and OR along with NOT to use a respective variables in it’s high or low state as required. Keep in mind that all laws are stated for us to design any digital circuit with the help of only AND and OR gate. Similarly, these laws are stated for the same. Commutative law . The word commutative is prefixed with the word ‘commute’ which means movement i.e., the movement of variables meaning if you switch or change the position of variables it won’t affect the result. Examples: A + B = B + A A . B = B . A . Associative law . The position of parenthesis does not matter. The basic idea of this law is that which set of variables you resolve first is not a matter of fact. Examples: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (A . B) . C = A . (B . C) . Idempotence law . As the word states ‘Identity’ tries to understand the importance of the term. When we apply AND gate to a single variable it will output the variable itself(*Conditions that we do not know the value of that variable). Similar will be the case when we will apply the OR gate. If you understand this then you got it ;) . Examples: A + A = A A . A = A . Distributive law . Suppose it’s your birthday and you want to distribute sweets to everyone in the class. What would the birthday reader do? Go to each person and distribute the sweets?. Awesome. That’s what happens in the case of Distributive law. Think of the number outside the parenthesis as the birthday variable who needs to attend each and every variable inside the parenthesis. Follow up the examples to understand better. Examples: A (B + C) = A.B + A.C A + (B.C) = (A + B)(A + C) . Redundance law . What do you do when you find two identical items while going to a track inside your bag? Obviously you remove one of the two redundant items. That’s what you need to do here, extract the common variable, and solve the expression inside the parenthesis. Examples: A + A.B = A A(A + B) = A //Here initial expression is reduced to A.A + A.B(Distributive Law) which can further be A + A.B(using Identity Law) . De Morgan’s law . This is the most important law of Boolean Algebra. Remember the phrase ‘Break the Line, change the Sign’ and ‘Join the Line, change the sign’ both are applicable. Meaning break the negate and change AND to OR and OR to AND within that negate sign. Do not remove the line. As the phrase speaks of breaking the line and changing the sign not removing the line. Be careful while applying this law. (A + B)' = (A'B') (AB)' = (A' + B') . Try to implement any gate you wish to with the help of the simulator present below, where ‘switch on’ means a high state i.e., 1 and ‘switch off’ means a low state i.e., 0.

The main point is to evaluate the value of Boolean expression for each and every combination of the Truth values of variables present. Suppose there is only one variable, it implies that it can hold either ‘true’ or ‘false’ but, when there are two variables then you can have a combination of {TT, TF, FT, FF}(T -&gt; True, F -&gt; False). Implies you need to evaluate the value of expression for each and every Truth value of a variable. The above implications bring us to a conclusion that there can be 2^(number of variables) number of combination for a single boolean expression. Follow up the examples below to learn how to map those values. Example: F(A,B) = A + B . Truth Table:: . | A | B | F(A,B) | . | 0 | 0 | 0 | . | 0 | 1 | 1 | . | 1 | 0 | 1 | . | 1 | 1 | 1 | .

A minterm is defined as the product term of n variables, in which each of the n variables will appear once either in its complemented or un-complemented form. The min term is denoted as mi where i is in the range of 0 ≤ i &lt; 2n. For a 2-variable (x and y) Boolean function, the possible minterms are: . x’y’, x’y, xy’ and xy. For a 3-variable (x, y and z) Boolean function, the possible minterms are: . x’y’z’, x’y’z, x’yz’, x’yz, xy’z’, xy’z, xyz’ and xyz. 1 – Minterms = minterms for which the function F = 1. 0 – Minterms = minterms for which the function F = 0. Any Boolean function can be expressed as the sum (OR) of its 1- min terms. The representation of the equation will be . F(list of variables) = Σ(list of 1-min term indices) . Ex: F(x, y, z) = Σ(3, 5, 6, 7) . The inverse of the function can be expressed as a sum (OR) of its 0- min terms. The representation of the equation will be . F(list of variables) = Σ(list of 0-min term indices) Ex: F’(x, y, z) = Σ(0, 1, 2, 4) . Examples of canonical form of sum of products expressions (min term canonical form): . | Z = XY + XZ′ . | F = XYZ′ + X′YZ + X′YZ′ + XY′Z + XYZ . | . In standard SOP form, the maximum possible product terms for n number of variables are given by 2n. So, for 2 variable equations, the product terms are 22 = 4. Similarly, for 3 variable equations, the product terms are 23 = 8. Maxterms . A max term is defined as the product of n variables, within the range of 0 ≤ i &lt; 2n. The max term is denoted as Mi. In max term, each variable is complemented, if its value is assigned to 1, and each variable is un-complemented if its value is assigned to 0. For a 2-variable (x and y) Boolean function, the possible max terms are: . x + y, x + y’, x’ + y and x’ + y’ . For a 3-variable (x, y and z) Boolean function, the possible maxterms are: . x + y + z, x + y + z’, x + y’ + z, x + y’ + z’, x’ + y + z, x’ + y + z’, x’ + y’ + z and x’ + y’ + z’ . 1 – Max terms = max terms for which the function F = 1. 0 – max terms = max terms for which the function F = 0. Any Boolean function can be expressed the product (AND) of its 0 – max terms. The representation of the equation will be . F(list of variables) = Π (list of 0-max term indices) . Ex: F(x, y, z) = Π(0, 1, 2, 4) . The inverse of the function can be expressed as a product (AND) of its 1 – max terms. The representation of the equation will be . F(list of variables) = Π(list of 1-max term indices) . Ex: F’(x, y, z) = Π(3, 5, 6, 7) . Examples of canonical form of product of sums expressions (max term canonical form): . 1. Z = (X + Y).(X + Y′) 2. F = (X′ + Y + Z′).(X′ + Y + Z).(X′ + Y′ + Z′) . In standard POS form, the maximum possible sum terms for n number of variables are given by 2n. So, for 2 variable equations, the sum terms are 22 = 4. Similarly, for 3 variable equations, the sum terms are 23 = 8. Having understood minterms and maxterms, you are now in a position to understand canonical forms. Any Boolean function that is expressed as a sum of minterms or as a product of maxterms is said to be in its canonical form. When the SOP form of a Boolean expression is in canonical form, then each of its product term is called minterm. So, the canonical form of sum of products function is also known as minterm canonical form or Sum-of-minterms or standard canonical SOP form. Similarly, when the POS form of a Boolean expression is in canonical form, then each of its sum term is called maxterm. So, the canonical form of product of sums function is also known as maxterm canonical form or Product-of sum or standard canonical POS form. ",

    "content": "You can represent the one canonical formed equation in other canonical form i.e. you can represent the SOP form of equation in POS form and POS form equation in SOP form. To convert the canonical equations, you interchange the Σ and Π symbols after listing out the index numbers of the equations, which are excluded from the original form of equation. The important thing to remember about Boolean functions is that, the SOP and POS forms are Duals to each other. There are 2 steps to follow to convert the canonical form of the equations. They are:- . | Interchanging the operational symbols, Σ and Π in the equation. | Use the De Morgan’s principle of Duality to the index numbers of the Boolean function or writing the indexes of the terms that are not presented in the given form of equation. | . For Example:- . The SOP function F(A, B, C) = ∑(0, 2, 3, 5, 7) = A’B’C’ + AB’C’ + AB’C + ABC’ + ABC is written in POS form by . | changing the operational sign to Π . | writing the missing indexes of the terms, 001, 100 and 110. Now write the sum form for these noted terms. | . 001 = (A + B + C'), 100 = (A' + B + C), 110 = (A' + B’ + C) . Writing down the new equation in the form of POS form, . F(A, B, C) = Π(1, 4, 6) = (A + B + C') * (A' + B + C) * (A' + B’ + C’) . The POS function F(A, B, C) = Π(2, 3, 5) = (A + B' + C)(A + B' + C')(A' + B + C') is written in SOP form by . | changing the operational sign to Σ . | writing the missing indexes of the terms, 000, 001, 100, 110, and 111. Now write the product form for these noted terms. | . 000 = A’B’C’, 001 = A’B’C, 100 = AB’C’, 110 = ABC’, 111 = ABC . Writing down the new equation in the form of SOP form, . F(A, B, C) = Σ(0, 1, 4, 6, 7) = (A’B'C’) + (A’B’C) + (AB’C’) + (ABC’) + (ABC) . ",

    "content": "Minimal POS to canonical POS . You can include all the variables in each product term of the POS form equation, which doesn’t have all the variables by converting into standard POS form. The normal POS form function can be converted to standard POS form by using the Boolean algebraic law, (A * A’ = 0) and by following the below steps. | By adding each non-standard sum term to the product of its missing variable and its complement, which results in 2 sum terms . | Applying Boolean algebraic law, A + BC = (A + B) * (A + C) . | By repeating the step 1, until all resulting sum terms contain all variables . | . By these three steps you can convert the POS function into standard POS function. Example: F = (A’ + B + C)*(B’ + C + D’) * (A + B’ + C’ + D) . In the first term, the variable D or D’ is missing, so add D*D’ = 1 to it. Then . (A’ + B + C + D*D’) = (A’ + B + C + D) * (A’ + B + C + D’) . Similarly, in the second term, the variable A or A’ is missing, so add A*A’ = 1 to it. Then . (B’ + C + D’ + A*A’) = (A + B’ + C + D’) * (A’ + B’ + C + D’) . The third term is already in the standard form, as it has all the variables. Now the standard POS form equation of the function is . F = (A’ + B + C + D) * (A’ + B + C + D’) * (A + B’ + C + D’) * (A’ + B’ + C + D’) * (A + B’ + C’ + D) . Minimal SOP to canonical SOP .

By these two steps you can convert the SOP function into standard SOP function. In this process, for each missing variable in the function, the number of product terms will double. Example: Convert the non standard SOP function F = x y + x z + y z . Sol: . F = x y + x z + y z = x y (z + z’) + x (y + y’) z + (x + x’) y z = x y z + x y z’ + x y z + x y’ z + x y z + x’ y z = x y z + x y z’ + x y’ z + x’ y z .

While most of the formatting style is carried out automatically by the layout, templates and stylesheets in the SSG (jekyll) pipeline, it is important to also adhere to a common writing style in order to assure consistency of the book. Please use a neutral and simple language. Avoid slang. Also, technical jargon should be explained. Figures and tables . Figures and tables should include a description or caption, and they should be commented in text. If a figure or table is not part of the description, probably it is not needed and can be removed from the book. See an example in section Templates and examples. Equations . Equations can be typesetted in LaTeX to be rendered by MathJax. A few examples can be found in the Templates and examples section. If equations need to be referenced in the text, use numbered or labelled equations. General useful guidelines: . | There are many variants for the notation of negated variables, prefer the bar over the variable or the prime (complement) symbol. | For binary words with many literals (high number of bits) prefer a single letter with subscript numbers for each bit. For instance a four bit word can be written as $(x_3,x_2,x_1,x_0)$ instead of a different letter for each literal $(A,B,C,D)$. The least significant bit should be subscripted with 0. In case of ambiguity or if the opposite arrangement is necessary, use a superscript mark to identify the MSB and LSB: $(x_0^{\\text{MSB}},x_1,x_2,x_3^{\\text{LSB}})$ | . References . Information obtained from other sources should be properly cited and referenced. Check the Templates and examples section for examples.

    "content": "To help you with getting started with writing your contribution, please use the following templates and examples, accordingly: . | New chapter template | New section template | Equations example | Figure example | Table example | Bibliography example | . The structure of the book, as well as the navigation menu is handled by Jekyll’s Just-the-docs plugin. A two-level structure has been chosen. The top-level is for chapters and the second level is for sections in a chapter . New chapter template . Each chapter should be a directory under the docs directory. The index.md in the chapter directory is used for the Chapter text and table of contents. The index.md file should have the following contents: . --- layout: circuitverse title: Chapter title nav_order: 10 has_children: true has_toc: false --- # Long chapter title {: .no_toc} Introductory chapter text ## Chapter contents {: .no_toc .text-delta} {% include chapter_toc.html %} . The title and nav_order elements in the front matter should be filled-in accordingly. The other elements in the front matter block should be left as in the template above. After the “Long” chapter title an introductory text for the chapter can be added. It is followed by the ’ title and the include directive which create a list of links to the sections of the chapter according to their level and navigation order. New section template . Files for sections within a chapter must be placed in the chapter’s directory. Currently, the contents of the book are organised in three levels of difficulty: . | basic | medium | advanced | . The following code represents an empty section and can be used as a template . --- layout: circuitverse title: Section title nav_order: l0s000 cvib_level: advanced parent: Parent Chapter has_children: false --- # Long section title {: .no_toc} ## {: .no_toc .text-delta} 1. TOC {:toc} ## Title Text . Each section file should have content belonging only to one of these levels. Therefore, the front matter block presents the cvib_level which correspond to one of the levels. The parent element must be the name of the Chapter containing the section. The section’s title goes in the title element. To standardise the order of sections in the navigation bar according to the difficulty level, the nav_order element is an “encoded” string with this form: l, followed by a digit, followed by s, followed by three digits. l stands for level and is a number between 0 and 2 and represent the basic, medium and advanced level, respectively. s stands for section and the three digit number after it is a zero-padded number indicating the section position in the chapter. The other elements in the front matter block (layout, has_children) should be should be left as they are. After the front matter block comes the section’s title followed by the table of contents title and code to generate it automatically. After that, parts within the section can be added. Equations examples . Equations are processed using MathJax provided by the jekyll-spaceship plugin.

Therefore, instead of using direct inclusion of images in MD syntax, the Jekyll include mechanism is used to generate properly captioned figures in the HTML rendering. To use it, include a figure like this: . {% include image.html url=\"/assets/images/path-to-image/image.svg\" description=\"Image caption\" %} . For instance, the following code: . {% include image.html url=\"/assets/images/XnorGate.svg\" description=\"XNOR Gate\" %} . will render like this: . XNOR Gate Table examples . Complex tables can be handled by the jekyll-spaceship plugin. However, there is no support for table captions. As a workaround, the Table caption can be included in the first row and styled with the table caption CSS tblcap. |: Table: Sample data {: .tblcap} :||| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |:-----------:|:------------|------------:| row1 col2 | row1 col2 | row1 col3 | row2 col1 | row2 col2 | row2 col3 | . which renders to . | : Table: Sample data {: .tblcap} :|| |   |   | . | col 1 | col 2 | col 3 | . | row1 col2 | row1 col2 | row1 col3 | . | row2 col1 | row2 col2 | row2 col3 | . Bibliography example . Bibliographic references are processed by the jekyll-scholar plugin. It uses BibTeX files as the source for the references.

    "content": "The new Interactive Book for digital logic design requires you to study binary and its uses. In computing, a flag is a type of signal usually used to indicate whether something is true or false. To save time and make your program less complicated, you might want to combine these flags and send several pieces of information in one go. Imagine you wanted to send a message to your friend to indicate which subjects had set homework on a particular day. If it was only one subject, you can just send the name of the subect - e.g. English - but if there is more than one, it gets more complicated. One way to do it is to give each subject a number: . | Serial no. | Subject | . | 1 | English | . | 2 | Maths | . | 4 | Science | . | 8 | Computing | . | 16 | History | . | 32 | Geography | . | 64 | French | . | 128 | German | . You can send combinations of subjects by adding together the numbers and sending the total. Try it below: . Enter the homework code and click the button. Code: . This only works because of the numbers I’ve chosen - it’s a binary sequence, with each number being one of the binary column headings. This means that each total can only be made up from one combination of subjects. If they’d been numbered as 1 = English, 2 = Maths, 3 = Science, 4 = Computing, etc., then it wouldn’t work, because a code of 3 could represent English and Maths, or it could be Science on its own. To use this technique in your programming, you need to be familiar with bitwise logic . ",

You could use this in a game - e.g. to make a “space invader” - or you could use the same technique to make your own font. I made my own font that looked like my handwriting! . Characters were designed on an 8 x 8 grid, and created using eight numbers from 0-255. Each number was converted to binary and the resulting pattern of 0s and 1s was used to make a pattern of black and white dots on a single row. You can design a character in the same way by entering numbers from 0-255 in the boxes to the left of the grid.

    "content": "In 1985, a new programmable hardware architecture evolved from the PLDs , the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) developed by Xilix Inc. See the IEEE Chip Hall of Fame entry on the Xilinx XC2064 FPGA for some history about it. An FPGA chip contains several logic cells which can be arbitrarily interconnected according to the programmed configuration. Each logic cell holds a combinational element called Look-Up Table (LUT) and a D Flip-flop sequential element whose input is the LUT’s output. The output of the logic cell can be either the LUT output or the D Flip-Flop output, which can be selected by means of a MUX. By selecting the direct LUT output the cell acts as a “pure” combinational element. Otherwise, the cell acts as a synchronous sequential element. The LUT usually has a few input bits (3 to 6 bits) and 1 bit output. It is usually implemented using a MUX to select the programmed output for a specific input combination. FPGA also implement input-output cells (IO-cell) which also have a D Flip-flop which help synchronisation from . Check the interactive circuit below for examples of the logic-cell, the LUT and the IO-cell. FPGAs allow a complex circuit design to be programmed and re-programmed on a single integrated circuit, much like programming a microprocessor, but provides a similar performance as if the circuit had been implemented with actual discrete components, unlike microprocessors which are several orders of magnitude slower than the equivalent FSM implemented using digital logic discrete components. In general, FSM designs implemented in FPGA are faster and use less power than the same FSM implemented in a microprocessor. However, the design process might be a bit harder since it requires the skills to design logic circuits and not just software programming skills. The hardware configuration or programming is usually described using standardised languages known as hardware description languages or HDL. Two of the most common languages are Verilog and VHDL. More information about FPGA can be found in the website fpga4fun.com by Jean P. Nicolle. FPGA are so versatile than even full microprocessors can be implemented in them, although it might not be as cost effective as using microprocessor integrated circuits. ",

For instance, if our binary numbers are 8 bits wide, and the four most signigicant bits are used for the integer part and the four least significant bits for the fractional part, then the number 12.09 would be encoded as $\\underbrace{1_7 1_6 0_5 0_4}_{\\text{integer part}}\\, \\overbrace{1_3 0_2 0_1 1_0}^{\\text{fractional part}}$.

Similarly, perform a similar operation for the B variable. Since you are using a 2 variable expression, you can bound one variable to each axis and the visualization works fine in a 2x2 matrix. Let’s instead look at a more involved example with 4 variables: . You have now bounded the A and B variables to the vertical axis, and C and D variables to the horizontal axis.

Hence, let’s take a look at the SOP expressions: . F(ABCD) = A'B'C'D' + A'B'C'D F(0000) = 1 F(0001) = 1 Since the last bit is the same, you can ignore the D value, thus: F(ABCD) = A'B'C' You can confirm by simplifying algebraically: F(ABCD) = A'B'C'D' + A'B'C'D = A'B'C'(D' + D) = A'B'C' Therefore, the simplification is true.

However, you can take advantage of the fact that for any bit change horizontally or vertically, it’s irrelevant what that bit is. More concretely, take a look at the following example. 0000 0001 0100 0101 =&gt; A'B'C'D' + A'B'C'D + A'BC'D' + A'BC'D Regardless of the B variable, you still get true for all products in the SOP expression.

Since the differences in bits need to generalize throughout a binding of an axis, you can only have a binding of size 2^n for a given axis. For example, 1x1, 1x2, 1x4, 2x2, 2x4, 4x4. ",

    "content": "Overlapping groupings become more complex because there exist ambiguous cases and sometimes what may appear to be a locally optimal solution is not a globally optimal solution. The general technique for evaluating for overlapping groups follows a greedy algorithm. Define an unvisited cell as a cell that has a value of 1 however it is currently not matched with a grouping yet. Iterate through all the cells, and once you find a cell with 1, if it is unvisited then find the largest possible square or rectangle such that each side length is a power of 2, where all the cells are 1 in its enclosed area. If there is a tie for size (ie, 1x4 vs 2x2), assign the one that is a square (this is by convention). Repeat this process for all remaining unvisited cells. Note: You can overlap the groupings with already visited nodes, but you never instantiate a new grouping unless the current node is unvisited. In this example, at F(0000), you can create a grouping of size 2 (because 2 is the largest possible grouping, 3 is not a power of 2). Then iterate through to F(0001), however F(0001) was already resolved to a grouping. For the latest active cell, F(0011) is not resolved to a grouping thus it’s unvisited. The largest possible grouping is also of size 2, thus you create another group. To resolve the groupings into an SOP expression, iterate through the groups and identify changing bits: . Group 1: F(ABCD) = [0000, 0001] Group 2: F(ABCD) = [0001, 0011] For Group 1: 0000 0001 ^ ^ F(ABCD) = A'B'C'D' + A'B'C'D =&gt; A'B'C'(D + D') =&gt; A'B'C' For Group 2: 0001 0011 ^ ^ F(ABCD) = A'B'C'D + A'B'CD =&gt; A'B'D(C' + C) =&gt; A'B'D Now add the two results: F(ABCD) = A'B'C' + A'B'D =&gt; F(ABCD) = A'B'D + A'B'C' (by commutative property) .

However, consider adding a 1 to F(1111). Following the previous algorithm, iterating top-bottom and left-right, when getting to F(0110), the algorithm can choose to make the largest grouping. However, there are two possible groupings: . Candidate 1: F(ABCD) = [0011, 0010, 0111, 0110] Candidate 2: F(ABCD) = [0111, 0110, 1111, 1110] . Both groupings have the same size and are the same dimension. However, upon reaching F(1110), another grouping needs to be instantiated, in which case if the first candidate grouping was created then you made a group that did not necessarily increase the size of our SOP expression. This illustrates the idea that this is a greedy algorithm, and does not always return the most simplified SOP expression.

Other combinational and sequential components, such as MUXs, registers and counters are also part of the microprocessor to provide the functionality required by the software, to optimise its execution and to connect to other external components. One of the first “single-chip” microprocessors is the Intel 4004.

    "content": "In this architecture, each state is represented by the output of a MUX. A memory element (D type flip-flop) is added to the MUX output. The basic building block of this architecture is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1: MUX + D flip-flop building block. The selection lines $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ are connected to the system’s inputs. The multiplexed inputs $C_0,\\ldots,C_{2^n-1}$ are connected to the previous states (MUXs), and the output $F$ is connected to the next states (MUXs). During operation there will be only one MUX with its output activated, the one representing the current state. When an input combination triggers the transition to the next state the output of the MUX representing that next state will become active and the previously active MUX output will deactivate. For simplicity, we will consider a Moore FSM, however the system can be also configured for Mealy state machines adding the input conditions to the output decoder. The following transition cases can be combined to form any Finite State Machine: . | Multiple previous states transitioning to a common next state for the same input word. | No previous state for input combination $k$. | Output bit associated to multiple states (Moore style machine). | . The following are examples for each of these cases. Previous states for the same input word . States B and C will transit to next state A if the input $x=I_j$. Previous states for the same input word. No previous state for a given input word . State D has no previous state for input combination $x=I_k$. No previous state for a given input word.

    "content": "Karnaugh Maps for functions with a large number of literals are difficult to minimise. Usually, a K-map is manageable up to 5 or 6 input literals. MEV can help for functions with a couple more variables. If we look at computer data buses, the information is 8, 16, 32, 64 bits wide or more. Additionally, to do a joint optimisation of functions with multiple output variables, the K-maps for all the combinations of the output variables must be analysed. Also, the visual minimisation using K-maps cannot be programmed to be performed by a computer program. The Quine-McCluskey method is a tabular recursive algorithm, which can be programmed in software. It has no limitations regarding the number of input or output literals. However, it will take longer and more recursions to process functions with more variables (the complexity grows exponentially). ",

Here, Q is the present state and Q’ is the next state. As you can see, when J, K and Clock are equal to 1, toggling takes place, i.e. The next state will be equal to the complement of the present state. Now, let us look at the timing diagram of JK flip-flop. Here, T is the time period of the clock whereas delta t is the propagation delay. The delay between input and output is called a propagation delay. This is what was expected, but the output may not be like this all the time. This is where Race around condition comes into the play. Let us look at the timing diagram of JK flip-flop when the race around condition is considered. As you already know, when J, K and Clock are equal to 1, toggling takes place. Here, propagation delay has also been reduced, so the output will be given out at the instant input is given. So there is a toggling again. Therefore, whenever Clock is equal to 1 there are consecutive toggling. This condition is called as Race around condition. To put it in words, “ For JK flip-flop if J, K and Clock are equal to 1 the state of flip-flop keeps on toggling which leads to uncertainty in determining the output of the flip-flop. This problem is called Race around the condition. “’ This condition also exists in T flip-flop since T flip-flop also has toggling options. ",

    "title": "Ring counter",
    "content": "Similar to how the Serial-in Serial-out register requires ‘N’ clock pulses to shift N bit data, the ‘N’ Ring Counter produces a sequence of 0s and 1s, by having the rightmost D flip-flop as input to the leftmost D flip-flop as opposed to applying data externally. That is, the output of the last flip-flop is connected to the output of the first flip-flop in the ring. These patterns of states (0s and 1s) are repeated every ‘N’ clock cycles. The number of states in a Ring Counter are directly proportional to the number of flip-flops used. The block diagram of the 3-bit Ring counter is shown in the following figure. A 3-bit Ring Counter will contain only a 3-bit SIPO shift register. Assume, the initial status of the D flip-flops from leftmost to rightmost is Q2Q1Q0=001. Here, Q2 &amp; Q0 are MSB &amp; LSB respectively. You can understand the working of Ring counter from the following table. | No of positive edge of Clock | Serial Input = Q0 | Q2(MSB) | Q1 | Q0(LSB) | . | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 1 | . | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | . | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | . | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | . Due to the absence of the clock signal, the initial status of the D flip-flops is Q2Q1Q0=001. This state will repeat every third positive edge transition of the clock signal. Similarly, the following operations take place every positive edge of the clock cycle: . | Serial input of the first D flip-flop gets the previous output of the third flip-flop. Thus, the present output of the first D flip-flop is equal to the previous output of the third flip-flop. | The previous outputs of first and second D flip-flops are right-shifted by one bit. That implies that the present outputs of second and third D flip-flops are equal to the previous outputs of first and second D flip-flops. | . ",

Thus, ‘N’ bit Johnson Ring counter produces a sequence of states (pattern of zeros and ones) and it repeats for every ‘2N’ clock cycles. Johnson ring counter is also called the Twisted ring counter and Switch tail ring counter. The block diagram of 3-bit Johnson Ring counter is shown in the following figure. The 3-bit Johnson Ring counter also contains only a 3-bit SIPO shift register. Assume, initially, all the D flip-flops are cleared. So, Q2Q1Q0=000.

Each cell has an associated binary number usually referred to as “address”. The number of cells is determined by the address’ number of bits. The storage is “non-volatile”, meaning that when the data remains in the circuit even when the power is removed. In contrast, “volatile” storage, such as most Random Access Memory (RAM) circuits, cannot retain the stored binary information when the circuit is disconnected from power. Let $m$ be the address’ number of bits and $n$ the number of bits in each cell (output bits), then the ROM’s size (in bits) can be calculated as $2^m\\times n$. In fact, ROM circuits can be seen as combinational circuits capable of storing large truth-tables whose inputs correspond to the address. ",

    "content": "Every sequential circuit can also be represented by the following general model: . The first step in the synthesis process is to state the functional description of the system in terms of a FSM. The state machine can be formally represented by state diagrams or state tables. The number of state variables $(r)$ is directly related to the number of states which can represented by those state variables $(2^r)$. Also, the number of components or their size is related to the number of state variables. On the other hand, the devised FSM might contain redundant states. Therefore, in order to obtain an optimal circuit (in terms of the number of components and number of feedback connections) it is desirable to reduce the number of states by eliminating unnecesary ones. This is the second step in the process. To represent the state with the binary state variables, a binary code must be assigned to each state. A careful selection of the state codes can help in a later stage to minimise the number of components in the combinational logic block. The memory block can be implemented using any of the basic sequential building blocks (latches or flip-flops) or even simple delay lines. Once the type of memory components is decided, it is possible to declare the truth table for the combinational logic block whose inputs are the (external) inputs of the system and the state variables (or internal inputs), while the outputs correspond to the (external) outputs as well as the excitation variables, which will produce the next state by means of the memory block. Finding the optimal combinational logic circuit is the final step in the process. ",

    "content": "A typical example of a complex synchronous sequential system is the system controller of a vending machine. Functional description . Let’s consider the following simplified block diagram representing the vending machine: . The digital system controller has to interact with the three devices: . | Coin Receiver | Coin Return | Pop Drop | . The coin receiver has four (4) output signals which will be inputs for the system controller and two (2) signals in the other direction: . | CP: (Coin Present) output signal becomes high (or true) when a coin is inserted and being processed and goes back to low value when it finishes processing the coin. | S&lt;: (Total amount is less than product’s price) output signal becomes high if the amount of deposited coins is less than the product’s price. | S=: (Total amount is equal to the product’s price) output signal becomes high if the deposited amount is equal to the product’s price. | S&gt;: (Total amount is greater than product’s price) output signal becomes high if the amount exceeds the product’s price. | DA: (Decrement Accumulator) signal from the controller instructs the coin receiver to subtract the amount returned by the coin return device from the total sum and update the Sx signals. | CA: (Clear Accumulator) signal from the controller tells the coin receiver to clear the total amount. | . The coin return device has two (2) signal connected to the system controller one on each direction: . | RN: (Return Nickel) signal to the device triggers the return of a change (as long as S&gt; is high). | CR: (Changer Ready) signal from the device indicates the controller that the it has finished returning a coin. | . The pop drop device has also two (2) signals connected to the system controller one on each direction: . | DP: (Drop Pop) signal from the controller instructs the device to start the process of delivering the product. | PDR: (Pop Drop Ready) signal to the controller informs when the product has been delivered. | . The Finite State Machine (FSM) which models the process can be described by the following state diagram (note that the state codes have already been assigned, see the explanation in State assignment: . The initial state (a) waits a for a coin to be inserted, when that happens the machine transitions to state (b) and waits until the coin is processed by the coin receiver and then moves to state (c). In state (c) the total amount is checked: if it is still not enough it goes back to state (a) to wait for more coins to be inserted. If it is equal to the price of the product the machine gets to state (d) which triggers signal DP to release the product and waits until de pop drop device informs the process is finished by asserting the PDR signal. At this moment, the machine state becomes (e) which sends the CA signal to clear the total sum in the coin receiver and then goes back to the initial state (a). On the other hand, while at state (c), if total amount is greater than the price then the machine enters state (f) which sets signal RN to high in order to tell the coin return to return a fixed amount. When it is done, the coin return responds by sending a true value back to the controller using signal CR. When this happens the machine moves on to state (g) which activates signal DA to the coin receiver to update the total amount and changes back to state (c) to check the new amount. State assignment . Given the FSM state diagram the following conditions regarding state codes should be considered: . | (a) should be adjacent to (b) | (b) should be adjacent to (c) | (d) should be adjacent to (e) | (f) should be adjacent to (g) | . The following state map takes all considerations into account: . |   | :AB: ||| |   |   |   | . | C | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 | . | 0 | a | $\\phi$ | d | f | . | 1 | b | c | e | g | . Combinational synthesis . Given the state codes the output decoder can be represented by the following map: . |   | :AB: ||| |   |   |   | . | C | 00 | 01 | 11 | 10 | . | 0 |   |   | DP | RN | . | 1 |   |   | CA | DA | .

    "content": "Universal gates are gates which can be used to implement all other gates. This is useful as manufacturers only need to produce 1 type of universal gate to be able to use all other gates. The universal gates are NOR and NAND. This page will show you how to implement AND, OR and NOT gates using universal gates. The AND, OR and NOT gates are basic gates that are commonly used and are very important. ",

    "content": "The NOR gate is the opposite of the OR gate. It is like an OR gate followed by a NOT gate. Implementing NOT gate . A NOT gate can be implemented by passing the same input into both inputs of the NOR gate. Implementing OR gate . An OR gate can be implemented by passing the output of NOR to the NOT gate implemented earlier. Implementing AND gate . Since the NOR gate outputs true only when both inputs are 0, an AND gate can be implemented by inverting the inputs to a NOR gate. ",

Similarly to NOR, a NOT gate can also be implemented by joining the inputs of a NAND gate. Implementing OR gate . The only time the NAND gate output is 0 is when both inputs are 1. Therefore, by inverting the inputs of a NAND gate, an OR gate can be implemented. Implementing AND gate . The AND gate is simply the output of a NAND gate inverted. ",

    "content": "To simplify any given boolean expression, first find the minimum number of NAND gates required. To do this, carry out the following steps. Let’s find the minimum number of NAND gates required to simplify the logical expression: . F(A, B, C, D) = AB' + C'D . Step 1: Double negation . Since the NAND gate is a combination of a NOT gate and an AND gate, we first apply a double negation to the entire expression so that we are able to standardize it later on. Adding a double negation does not alter the inherent value of the expression as a double negation always nullifies itself. F = (F')' = ((AB' + C'D)')' . Step 2: Applying De Morgan’s law . We first apply De Morgan’s Law to the innermost bracket, such that we preserve the outermost negation at the time of expressing the F as a NAND expression. Thus, by applying De Morgan’s Law: . F = ((AB' + C'D)')' = ((AB')' . (C'D)')' . The boolean expression is now standardized such that it can completely be represented by a NAND gate at every input level. Step 3: Construct the NAND circuit . Now that you have gotten the boolean expression to the required standard, you can implement it as a NAND circuit. F = (A NAND B') NAND (C' NAND D) F = (A NAND (B NAND B)) NAND ((C NAND C) NAND D) . Notice that there are input elements that are present in the negative form, namely B' and C'. You can represent them by using the NAND gate in order to realise the NOT gate. ",
