# Contributing

[Back to `README.md`](README.md)

## Guidelines

1. Everything must start with an issue...
	* Issues should have useful, concise titles and enough of a description to understand the scope of the issue.

2. Branches should link to individual issues, and be named using consistent syntax consisting of "issue type", "issue number", and a descriptive title (using hyphens for spaces, and all lower case). Examples:
	* bug/#123-abbreviated-issue-title
	* feature/#123-abbreviated-issue-title
	* enhancement/#123-abbreviated-issue-title

3. Pull requests may not be merged by the requester. Ever.

4. Once a pull request is merged, the branch should be removed.

5. Always follow good Github etiquette. Several helpful reads on the topic:
	* [Use Github keywords to auto-link close issues](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)	
	* [Git - Contributing to a Project](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html)
	* [Who-T - On Commit Messages](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)
