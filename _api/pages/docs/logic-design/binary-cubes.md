TOC\n{:toc}\n\n\n## Another abstract representation\n\nThe simplicity in applying the *absorption* and *logic adjacency* in Karnaugh Maps is derived from another way of representing binary functions: the binary cubes.\n\nThis representation is also key to understand the Quine McCluskey algorithm to minimize logic functions.\n\nMore information can be found in the section on Karnaugh Maps in {% cite donzellini2018introduction --file books %}\n\n\n### Functions of 1 variable\n\nAny logic function of a single variable $f(x)$ can be represented by a line:\n\n{% include image.html url=\"/assets/images/comb/binary-cube-1var.svg\" description=\"Cube representing a logic function with one variable.\" %}\n\nThe points at both ends of the line indicate the values that the variable $x$ can take (0 or 1).\n\n\n### Functions of 2 variables\n\nIn a similar way a function of two variables can be represented by a square in a two-dimensional space:\n\n{% include image.html url=\"/assets/images/comb/binary-cube-2var.svg\" description=\"Cube representing a logic function with two variables.\" %}\n\nIn the figure it is easy to see that (1,0) and (0,1) are not adjacent, while (1,1) and (0,1) are adjacent.\n\n\n### Functions of 3 variables and more\n\nThis representation can be further extended to higher orders. For instance, a function with three variables would be represented by the following three-dimensional cube:\n\n{% include image.html url=\"/assets/images/comb/binary-cube-3var.svg\" description=\"Cube representing a logic function with three variables.\" %}\n\nAgain, the adjacencies can be identified by the lines connecting the corners of the cube. If there is not a line, those binary numbers are not adjacent.\n\nThe adjacency is key to group cubes in Karnaugh maps and in the Quine McCluskey method to obtain minimal expressions.\n\n\n## References\n\n{% bibliography --cited  --file books %}\n\n{:.quiz}\n1.
