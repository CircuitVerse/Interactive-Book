First, give the change.\n2. Then dispense the can.\n\n## Understanding the possibilities \nThere are quite some options like:\n1. entering no money.\n2. putting 5¢ followed by another 10¢ => getting the can.\n3. putting 10¢ followed by 10¢ => receiving  change => getting a can.\n4. putting 5¢ followed by 5¢ followed by 10¢=> receiving  change => getting a can.\n5. putting 10¢ followed by 5¢ and getting the can.\n6. putting 5$ followed by 5¢ followed by 5¢ => getting a can.\n\n## FSM diagram\nNow translate the options which are listed above into an FSM diagram/flow-chart:\n\n{% include fsm.html %}\n\nLets try the soda can vending machine and look for the corresponding state changes FSM diagram in each of the above mentioned possibilities.\n",
