It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU).\n\nThe purpose of the ALU is to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
