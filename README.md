## About the project
The aim of this project is to create an _online interactive guide_ for _digital logic design_. The primary goal is to develop an open sourcebook with quality content that teaches digital logic design. It will enable students to learn digital design by interacting with circuits, truth tables, and other interactive elements as they proceed through the book. Professors and students all over the world can read and contribute to the same.

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

### CircuitVerse
[CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org) is a product developed by students at IIIT-Bangalore. It aims to provide a platform where circuits can be designed and simulated using a graphical user interface. While users can design complete CPU implementations within the simulator, the software is designed primarily for educational use. CircuitVerse is an opensource project with an active community.
