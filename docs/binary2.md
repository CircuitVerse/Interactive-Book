## Binary system complements
{: .d-inline-block}
{% include button.html %}
</div>

As the binary system has base r = 2. So the two types of complements for the binary system are 2's complement and 1's complement.


<div class="main_sub_heading" markdown="1">
### 1's complement
{: .d-inline-block}
{% include button.html %}
</div>

The 1's complement of a number is found by changing all 1's to 0's and all 0's to 1's. This is called as taking complement or 1's complement. Example of 1's Complement is as follows.

```yaml
Given number        1  0  1  0  1
1's complement      0  1  0  1  0 
```
<div class="main_sub_heading" markdown="1">
### 2's complement
{: .d-inline-block}
{% include button.html %}
</div>

The 2's complement of binary number is obtained by adding 1 to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of 1's complement of the number.
2's complement = 1's complement + 1


```yaml
Given number        1  0  1  0  1
1's complement      0  1  0  1  0 

add 1               +           1
                   ---------------
2's complement      0  1  0  1  1             
                   --------------- 

```

### Bitwise Operators
{: .d-inline-block}
{% include button.html %}
</div>

|Operator   |    Explanation   |
|:---------:|:----------------:|
|op1 & op2 | The AND operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.|
|op1 or op2 | The OR operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if the bits are complementary; otherwise, it returns 0.|
|op1^ op2 | The EXCLUSIVE-OR operator compares two bits and returns 1 if either of the bits are 1 and it gives 0 if both bits are 0 or 1.|
|~op1 | The COMPLEMENT operator is used to invert all of the bits of the operand.|
