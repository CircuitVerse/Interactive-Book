## Introduction


It is a device which performs logic operations on one or more logical inputs, and produces a single logical output.
Logic gates can be categorized into 3 groups:
1. Basic Gates: NOT, AND, OR
2. Universal Gates: NAND, NOR
3. Arithmetic Gates: X-OR, X-NOR

## Truth Table

The Table which contains all logical possibilities is known as truth table.

## NOT gate

The NOT gate is also known as an inverter because it inverts the logic sense of a binary variable. It has one input and one output. The Truth table for NOT gate is given below

| Input        | Output     |
|:------------:|:------------:|
| 0            | 1            | 
| 1            | 0            |

## AND gate

Basically, the AND gate's operation is similar to that of multiplication. It has two inputs and one output. The output is high (1) if both inputs are 1, and for all other cases, the output is low (0).
The Truth table for AND gate which consists of two inputs is given below

| Input1       | Input 2      | Output |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------:|
| 0            | 0            | 0      |
| 0            | 1            | 0      |
| 1            | 0            | 0      |
| 1            | 1            | 1      |

## OR gate

Basically, the OR gate's operation is similar to that of addition. It has two inputs and one output. If at least one of the inputs is 1, then the output will be high (1). If neither of the inputs is 1, the output will be low (0).
The Truth table of OR gate which consists of two inputs is given below

| Input1       | Input 2      | Output |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------:|
| 0            | 0            | 0      |
| 0            | 1            | 1      |
| 1            | 0            | 1      |
| 1            | 1            | 1      |

## NAND gate

The NAND gate is the complement of the AND gate. You can think of it as an AND gate followed immediately by a NOT gate. Its output is low (0) when both the inputs are 1, and for all other cases, its output is high (1). The symbol of NAND gate consists of AND gate followed by a small circle.
The Truth table of NAND gate which consists of two inputs is given below

| Input1       | Input 2      | Output |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------:|
| 0            | 0            | 1      |
| 0            | 1            | 1      |
| 1            | 0            | 1      |
| 1            | 1            | 0      |

## NOR gate

The NOR gate is the complement of the OR gate. You can think of it as an OR gate followed immediately by a NOT gate. Its output is low (0) when one or both of the inputs are 1, and for all other cases, its output is high (1). The symbol of NOR gate consists of OR gate followed by a small circle.
The Truth table of NOR gate which consists of two inputs is given below

| Input1       | Input 2      | Output |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------:|
| 0            | 0            | 1      |
| 0            | 1            | 0      |
| 1            | 0            | 0      |
| 1            | 1            | 0      |

## XOR gate

The XOR (or) Exclusive-OR is a digital Logic gate that gives the output as high (1) if and only if one of the input is 1.
The Truth table of XOR gate which consists of two inputs is given below

| Input1       | Input 2      | Output |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------:|
| 0            | 0            | 0      |
| 0            | 1            | 1      |
| 1            | 0            | 1      |
| 1            | 1            | 0      |

## XNOR gate

The XNOR (or) Exclusive-NOR is a digital Logic gate that gives the output as high (1) when both the inputs are same.
The Truth table of XNOR gate which consists of two inputs is given below

| Input1       | Input 2      | Output |
|:------------:|:------------:|:------:|
| 0            | 0            | 1      |
| 0            | 1            | 0      |
| 1            | 0            | 0      |
| 1            | 1            | 1      |
