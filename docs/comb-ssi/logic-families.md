## Technologies behind logic integrated circuits

There are many technologies available to implement digital logic components which work according to the Boolean algebra's laws and rules. The most common technologies are known as TTL and CMOS logic families, however many variations exist. Each technology presents unique features such as propagation time, power requirements, logic levels, heat dissipation among others. Also, its packaging requires careful consideration when implementing an actual circuit.

A full description of logic families can be found in the following resources:

-   Chapter 2 "Logic Gates" in {% cite morris2013digital --file books %}
-   Section 3.3 "Logic Families" in {% cite lameres2019introduction --file books %}
-   Chapter 8 "Practical digital circuits" in {% cite stonham2017digital --file books %}
-   Chapter 5 "Integrated Logic" in {% cite ferdjallah2011introduction --file books %}

Also, logic component manufacturers also publishes information about their current logic families technologies. As an example, check {% cite tilogicfamilies --file tidocs %}.
