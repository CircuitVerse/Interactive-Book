# Digital Combinational Circuits
{: .no_toc }


Combinational circuits are made up of different Logic gates. These circuits are operated with the help of binary values. The output(s) of these circuits depend on the values of the given input at that time. Given below is the **block diagram** of Combinational circuit.

The above Combinational circuit has 'n' number of input variables, and ‘m’ number outputs. The output(s) is affected by input variables of each combination. 

## Procedure of Designing Combinational Circuits

1.  Determine the required number of input variables and output variables as per the desired output.
1.  Derive the Truth table. The total possible combinations for 'n' number of input variables is equal '2n'. Find the output value, for every combination of input.   
1.  The boolean expression for each output is found. Simplify the expressionss if needed.   
1.  The above simplified boolean expressions are used, corresponding to its output by the use of Logic gates.
   
   
Now, we're elaborating a few more important Combinational circuits as follows-
