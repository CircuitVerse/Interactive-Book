# Half Subtractors
{: .no_toc }

Half subtractor is a combination circuit with two inputs ( A and B ) and two outputs (difference and borrow). 
It is used to calculate the difference between the two binary bits at the input and also produces an output (Borrow) to indicate if a 1 has been borrowed. 
In the subtraction (A-B), A is called as Minuend bit and B is called as Subtrahend bit.
