# Half Subtractors
{: .no_toc }

Half subtractor is a combination circuit with two inputs and two outputs (difference and borrow). 
It produces the difference between the two binary bits at the input and also produces an output (Borrow) to indicate if a 1 has been borrowed. 
In the subtraction (A-B), A is called as Minuend bit and B is called as Subtrahend bit.
