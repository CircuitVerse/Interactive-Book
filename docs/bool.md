## Introduction


Boolean Algebra is used to analyze and simplify the digital (logic) circuits. 
It uses only the binary numbers i.e. 0 and 1. 
It is also called as Binary Algebra or logical Algebra. 
Boolean algebra was invented by George Boole in 1854.



## Rule in Boolean Algebra
Following are the important rules used in Boolean algebra.

1. Variable used can have only two values. Binary 1 for HIGH and Binary 0 for LOW.
1. Complement of a variable is represented by an overbar (-) or (!). Thus, complement of variable B is represented as B Bar. Thus if B = 0 then !B  = 1 and B = 1 then !B  = 0.
1. ORing of the variables is represented by a plus (+) sign between them. For example ORing of A, B, C is represented as A + B + C.
1. Logical ANDing of the two or more variable is represented by writing a dot between them such as A.B.C. Sometime the dot may be omitted like ABC.

## Boolean Laws

There are six types of Boolean Laws.

### AND law

These laws use the AND operation. Therefore they are called as **AND** laws.
```yaml
Example:  
1. A.0 = 0
1. A.1 = A
1. A.A = A
1. A.!A = 0
```

### OR law

These laws use the OR operation. Therefore they are called as **OR** laws.
```yaml
Example:  
1. A+0 = A
2. A+1 = 1
3. A+A = A
4. A+!A = 1
```

### INVERSION law

This law uses the NOT operation. The inversion law states that double inversion of a variable results in the original variable itself.

```yaml
Example:  !!A = A
```


### Idempotent law

The idempotent law states that `x OR x is x` and `x AND x is x`.

```yaml
Example:  A + A = A
```


### Annulment law

The annulment law states that `x OR 1 is 1` and `x AND 0 is 0`.

```yaml
Example:  A.0 = 0
```


### Identity law

This law states that anything (x) added to zero or multiplied by 1 equals the original “anything,” no matter what value that “anything” (x) may be.

```yaml
Example:  A + 0 = A
```


### Commutative law

Any binary operation which satisfies the following expression is referred to as commutative operation.
```yaml
Example:  A.B = B.A                         A+B = B+A
```


### Associative law

This law states that the order in which the logic operations are performed is irrelevant as their effect is the same.

```yaml
Example: (A.B).C = A.(B.C)                (A+B)+C = A+(B+C)
```

### Distributive law

Distributive law states the following condition.
```yaml
Example:  A.(B+C) = A.B + A.C

```


## DeMorgan’s Theorem
This theorem is useful in finding the **complement of Boolean function**. It states that the complement of logical OR of at least two Boolean variables is equal to the logical AND of each complemented variable.

DeMorgan’s theorem with 2 Boolean variables x and y can be represented as
```yaml
  (x + y)’ = x’.y’
```
The dual of the above Boolean function is
```yaml
  (x.y)’ = x’ + y’
```
Therefore, the complement of logical AND of two Boolean variables is equal to the logical OR of each complemented variable. Similarly, we can apply DeMorgan’s theorem for more than 2 Boolean variables also.
