{: .no_toc }

There are two types of memory elements based on the type of triggering that is suitable to operate it.

* Latches
* Flip-flops

Latches operate with enable signal, which is level sensitive. 
Whereas, flip-flops are edge sensitive. 
We will discuss about flip-flops in next module. 
Now, let us discuss about SR Latch & D Latch one by one.
