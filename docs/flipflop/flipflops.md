# Flip-Flops
{: .no_toc }

Latches are the basic building blocks of Flip-flops. Flip-flops can be implemented in two methods.

In the first method, Two latches are cascaded in such a way that the first latch is being enabled for all positive clock pulses, and the second latch is being enabled for al negative clock pulses. So that the 
resultant of the combination of the two latches becomes a Flip-flop.

In the second module,Edge sensitive Flip-flops can be directly implemented. In this module,the Flip-flops are discussed using the second method.



## Conclusion

In this module, we have implemented various Flip-flops by providing the cross coupling between the NOR-gates. In the same way, you can implement these Flip-flops by using NAND-gates.
