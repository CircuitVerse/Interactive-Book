{: .no_toc }


The binary coded data, and the information in digital systems are operated continuously by some operation. 
Some operations include:

1. Multiplexing.
2. Demultiplexing.
3. Decoding and Encoding.

These operations and also many other operations are faciliated(helped) by the availability of many ICs in the MSI(Medium-Scale-Integration) category.
Now in this module, Let's study some commonly used types of MSI devices. 
In each type, firstly a brief discussion of the basic operating principles will be given, then followed by the introductin of some specific ICs.
Then we will learn how these are used alone/By combining them with other ICs for different applications.
