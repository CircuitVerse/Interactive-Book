# MSI
{: .no_toc }


Digital systems obtain binary-coded data and information that are continuously being operated on in some manner. 
Some of the operations include:

1. Multiplexing
2. Demultiplexing
3. Decoding and Encoding

All of these operations and others have been facilitated by the availability of numerous ICs in the MSI
(medium-scale-integration) category.
In this module, we will study many of the common types of MSI devices. 
For each type, we will start with a brief discussion of its basic operating principle and then introduce specific ICs. 
We then show how they can be used alone or in combination with other ICs in various applications.
