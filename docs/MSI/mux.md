# Multiplexers
{: .no_toc }

The multiplexer(or mux) is a unique type of Combinational-circuit. 
It consists of n number of data inputs, 1 output and m number of selected inputs with, 2m = n. 
This is a digital circuit, which selects 1 input, and it is routed to the output from n data inputs. 
The selected inputs selects of one from n data inputs. 1 out of n data sources, is first selected and then transmitted to Y which is the single output. 
E is called strobe/the enable input, which is helpful for cascading. This will perform the desired operation, when it is low/an active low terminal.
