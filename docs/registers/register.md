# Digital Registers
{: .no_toc }

Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the digital data. 
To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, we have to use a group of flip-flops. Such a group of flip-flops is known as a Register. 
The n-bit register will consist of n number of flip-flop(s) and it is capable of storing an n-bit word.

The binary data in a register can be moved within the register from one flip-flop to another. 
The registers that allow such data transfers are called as shift registers. 
There are four modes of operations of a shift register. Let's discuss them one-by-one.
