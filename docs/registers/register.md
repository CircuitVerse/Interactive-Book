# Digital Registers
{: .no_toc }

A register consists of a group of binary-cells which can be used to hold binary data, and Flip-flops can be used as the binary-cells.
One Flip-flop has a capacity to store 1 bit of biary data.
We can increase the the memory capacity of registers by using a group of Flip-flops.
An n-bit register can be formed by cascading 'n' number of Flip-flops, which can store 'n' bits of data.

The binary-data which is in the register can be transfered within itself from one Flip-flop to another. 
A shift register is a type of register that allows such data transfers.
Shift register has 4 modes of operations:
