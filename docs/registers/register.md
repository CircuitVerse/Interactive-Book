## Introduction


A Flip-flop is a 1 bit memory cell which can be used for storing the digital data. 
To increase the storage capacity in terms of number of bits, you can use a group of flip-flops. Such a group of flip-flops is known as a Register. 
The n-bit register will consist of n number of flip-flop(s) and it is capable of storing an n-bit word.


The binary-data, in a register, can be transfered within itself from one flip-flop to another. 
A shift register is a type of register that allows such data transfers.
Shift register has 4 modes of operations.
