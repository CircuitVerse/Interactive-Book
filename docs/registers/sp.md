# Serial Input Parallel Output
{: .no_toc }




## Introduction
 
* In such types of operations, the data is entered serially and taken out in parallel fashion.

* Data is loaded bit by bit. The outputs are disabled as long as the data is loading.

* As soon as the data loading gets completed, all the flip-flops contain their required data, the outputs are enabled so that all the loaded data is made available over all the output lines at the same time.

* 4 clock cycles are required to load a four bit word. Hence the speed of operation of SIPO mode is same as that of SISO mode.
