# Parallel Input Parallel Output
{: .no_toc }




## Introduction
 
In this mode, the 4-bit binary input B0, B1, B2, B3 is applied to the binary-data inputs D0, D1, D2, D3 respectively of the 4 Flip-flops. 
When a negative edge of the clock is applied, then the Flip-flops will get loaded with the input binary bits simultaneously. 
The output side will get appeared with the loaded bits simultaneously.  
Only the clock pulse is important to load all the biary bits.
