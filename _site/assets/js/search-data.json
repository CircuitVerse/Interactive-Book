    "content": "N-Bit Parallel Adder The Full Adder is capable of adding only two single digit binary number along with a carry input. But in practical we need to add binary numbers which are much longer than just one bit. To add two n-bit binary numbers we need to use the n-bit parallel adder. It uses a number of full adders in cascade. The carry output of the previous full adder is connected to carry input of the next full adder. 4 Bit Parallel Adder In the block diagram, A0 and B0 represent the LSB of the four bit words A and B. Hence Full Adder-0 is the lowest stage. Hence its Cin has been permanently made 0. The rest of the connections are exactly same as those of n-bit parallel adder is shown in fig. The four bit parallel adder is a very common logic circuit. Block Diagram N-Bit Parallel Subtractor The subtraction can be carried out by taking the 1’s or 2’s complement of the number to be subtracted. For example we can perform the subtraction (A-B) by adding either 1’s or 2’s complement of B to A. That means we can use a binary adder to perform the binary subtraction. 4 Bit Parallel Subtractor The number to be subtracted (B) is first passed through inverters to obtain its 1’s complement. The 4-bit adder then adds A and 2’s complement of B to produce the subtraction. S3 S2 S1 S0 represents the result of binary subtraction (A-B) and carry output Cout represents the polarity of the result. If A &gt; B then Cout = 0 and the result of binary form (A-B) then Cout = 1 and the result is in the 2’s complement form. Block Diagram 8 Bit Full Adder And Subtractor  ",

    "content": "ALU Introduction In Detail Introduction An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU). The purpose of the ALU is to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Additionally, the ALU processes basic logical operations like AND/OR calculations. Also known as the arithmetic logic unit, it serves as the computational hub of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) for a computer system In Detail So with the above building blocks i.e. half adder and full adder discussed in Combinational Analysis, lets construct a simple ALU that performs a arithmetic operation (1 bit addition)and does 3 logical operations namely AND, NOR and XOR as shown below. The multiplexer selects only one operation at a time. The operation selected depends on the selection lines of the multiplexer as shown in the truth table. Input = M1,M0 &amp; Output = Operation M1 M0 Operation 0 0 SUM 1 0 AND 0 1 OR 1 1 XOR Now we can take up the 1 bit ALU as block and construct a 4 bit ALU, which performs all the functions of the 1 bit ALU on the 4 bit inputs. Thus a single building block can be constructed and used recursively. The inputs A and B are four bits and the output is 4 bit as well. Figure below illustrates it: There are a few important takeaways here: The selection lines MO and M1 select the function ALU performs. These selection lines combined with the input arguments and desired functions a Instruction Set can be formed. These Instructions can used to create meaningful programs. Since these are required to be easily available they can be stored on ROM unit. The input arguments A and B are often stored in Internal Registers. These along with other special purpose register form the registers of the microcontroller. ROM memories are slower in speed, hence an intermediate high speed RAM is often used. All the critical timings, decoding of the instructions are often grouped together in seperate control and timings unit’ If a Micro controller would be constructed only from ALU, RAM, ROM there would not be any external interface. Hence we have Input/Output IO ports. Additional features such as ‘Interrupts, communication protocols, EEPROM, Timers/Counters, Debug interfaces etc are incorporated to make a controller complete. In above discussion we might have left out intricate details involved in a ALU, CPU design. But the aim was to understand ALU/CPU at a deeper level.

    "title": "Application of Shift Registers",
    "content": "In previous module, we discussed four types of shift registers. Based on the requirement, we can use one of those shift registers. Following are the applications of shift registers. Shift register is used as Parallel to serial converter, which converts the parallel data into serial data. It is utilized at the transmitter section after Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) block. Shift register is used as Serial to parallel converter, which converts the serial data into parallel data. It is utilized at the receiver section before Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) block. Shift register along with some additional gate(s) generate the sequence of zeros and ones. Hence, it is used as sequence generator. Shift registers are also used as counters. There are two types of counters based on the type of output from right most D flip-flop is connected to the serial input. Those are Ring counter and Johnson Ring counter. In this module, let us discuss about these two counters one by one. Ring Counter Johnson Ring Counter Ring Counter In previous module, we discussed the operation of Serial In - Parallel Out (SIPO) shift register. It accepts the data from outside in serial form and it requires ‘N’ clock pulses in order to shift ‘N’ bit data. Similarly, ‘N’ bit Ring counter performs the similar operation. But, the only difference is that the output of rightmost D flip-flop is given as input of leftmost D flip-flop instead of applying data from outside. Therefore, Ring counter produces a sequence of states (pattern of zeros and ones) and it repeats for every ‘N’ clock cycles. The block diagram of 3-bit Ring counter is shown in the following figure. The 3-bit Ring counter contains only a 3-bit SIPO shift register. The output of rightmost D flip-flop is connected to serial input of left most D flip-flop. Assume, initial status of the D flip-flops from leftmost to rightmost is Q2Q1Q0=001. Here, Q2 &amp; Q0 are MSB &amp; LSB respectively. We can understand the working of Ring counter from the following table. No of positive edge of Clock Serial Input = Q0 Q2(MSB) Q1 Q0(LSB) 0 - 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 1 The initial status of the D flip-flops in the absence of clock signal is Q2Q1Q0=001. This status repeats for every three positive edge transitions of clock signal. Therefore, the following operations take place for every positive edge of clock signal. Serial input of first D flip-flop gets the previous output of third flip-flop. So, the present output of first D flip-flop is equal to the previous output of third flip-flop. The previous outputs of first and second D flip-flops are right shifted by one bit. That means, the present outputs of second and third D flip-flops are equal to the previous outputs of first and second D flip-flops. Johnson Ring Counter The operation of Johnson Ring counter is similar to that of Ring counter. But, the only difference is that the complemented output of rightmost D flip-flop is given as input of leftmost D flip-flop instead of normal output. Therefore, ‘N’ bit Johnson Ring counter produces a sequence of states (pattern of zeros and ones) and it repeats for every ‘2N’ clock cycles. Johnson Ring counter is also called as Twisted Ring counter and switch tail Ring counter. The block diagram of 3-bit Johnson Ring counter is shown in the following figure. The 3-bit Johnson Ring counter also contains only a 3-bit SIPO shift register. The complemented output of rightmost D flip-flop is connected to serial input of left most D flip-flop. Assume, initially all the D flip-flops are cleared. So, Q2Q1Q0=000. Here, Q2 &amp; Q0 are MSB &amp; LSB respectively. We can understand the working of Johnson Ring counter from the following table. No of positive edge of Clock Serial Input = Q0 Q2(MSB) Q1 cQ0(LSB) 0 - 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 0 3 1 1 1 1 4 0 0 1 1 5 0 0 0 1 6 0 0 0 0 The initial status of the D flip-flops in the absence of clock signal is Q2Q1Q0=000. This status repeats for every six positive edge transitions of clock signal. Therefore, the following operations take place for every positive edge of clock signal. Serial input of first D flip-flop gets the previous complemented output of third flip-flop. So, the present output of first D flip-flop is equal to the previous complemented output of third flip-flop. The previous outputs of first and second D flip-flops are right shifted by one bit. That means, the present outputs of second and third D flip-flops are equal to the previous outputs of first and second D flip-flops. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

    "content": "Basic Apllications Binary Flags Representing a Character Binary Flags The new Interactive Book for Digital logic design requires you to study binary binary and its uses. In computing, a flag is a type of signal usually used to indicate whether something is true or false. To save time and make your program less complicated, you might want to combine these flags and send several pieces of information in one go. Imagine you wanted to send a message to your friend to indicate which subjects had set homework on a particular day. If it was only one subject, you can just send the name of the subect - e.g. English - but if there is more than one, it gets more complicated. One way to do it is to give each subject a number: Serial no. Subject 1 English 2 Maths 4 Science 8 Computing 16 History 32 Geography 64 French 128 German You can send combinations of subjects by adding together the numbers and sending the total. Try it below: Enter the homework code and click the button. Code: This only works because of the numbers I’ve chosen - it’s a binary sequence, with each number being one of the binary column headings. This means that each total can only be made up from one combination of subjects. If they’d been numbered as 1 = English, 2 = Maths, 3 = Science, 4 = Computing, etc., then it wouldn’t work, because a code of 3 could represent English and Maths, or it could be Science on its own. To use this technique in your programming, you need to be familiar with bitwise logic Representing a Character The computer that we had when we were in the 80s - in common with a lot of personal computers at the time - allowed you to design your own text character. You could use this in a game - e.g. to make a “space invader” - or you could use the same technique to make your own font. I made my own font that looked like my handwriting! Characters were designed on an 8 x 8 grid, and created using eight numbers from 0-255. Each number was converted to binary and the resulting pattern of 0s and 1s was used to make a pattern of black and white dots on a single row. You can design a character in the same way by entering numbers from 0-255 in the boxes to the left of the grid. Each number is converted to binary and used to create the pattern of dots. 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 You can design a character in the same way by entering numbers from 0-255 in the boxes to the left of the grid. Each number is converted to binary and used to create the pattern of dots. Fonts on a modern computer would be made up of a lot more than 64 pixels, but the principle is the same. If you can’t see how the numbers are converted into the patterns of black and white blocks, try looking at the page on binary. If you can see the link between the number and the pattern, then think about how the web page works Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

So the two types of complements for the binary system are 2’s complement and 1’s complement. 1’s complement The 1’s complement of a number is found by changing all 1’s to 0’s and all 0’s to 1’s. This is called as taking complement or 1’s complement. Example of 1’s Complement is as follows. Given number 1 0 1 0 1 1&#39;s complement 0 1 0 1 0 2’s complement The 2’s complement of binary number is obtained by adding 1 to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of 1’s complement of the number. 2’s complement = 1’s complement + 1 Given number 1 0 1 0 1 1&#39;s complement 0 1 0 1 0 add 1 + 1 2&#39;s complement 0 1 0 1 1 Bitwise Operators Operator Explanation op1 &amp; op2 The AND operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0. op1 or op2 The OR operator compares two bits and generates a result of 1 if the bits are complementary; otherwise, it returns 0. op1^ op2 The EXCLUSIVE-OR operator compares two bits and returns 1 if either of the bits are 1 and it gives 0 if both bits are 0 or 1. ~op1 The COMPLEMENT operator is used to invert all of the bits of the operand. 1280 640 320 160 80 40 20 10 = AND OR XOR AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND 1280 640 320 160 80 40 20 10 = = = = = = = = = 1280 640 320 160 80 40 20 10 = 0 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

It uses only the binary numbers i.e. 0 and 1. It is also called as Binary Algebra or logical Algebra. Boolean algebra was invented by George Boole in 1854. Rule in Boolean Algebra Following are the important rules used in Boolean algebra. Variable used can have only two values. Binary 1 for HIGH and Binary 0 for LOW. Complement of a variable is represented by an overbar (-) or (!). Thus, complement of variable B is represented as B Bar. Thus if B = 0 then !B = 1 and B = 1 then !B = 0. ORing of the variables is represented by a plus (+) sign between them. For example ORing of A, B, C is represented as A + B + C. Logical ANDing of the two or more variable is represented by writing a dot between them such as A.B.C. Sometime the dot may be omitted like ABC. Boolean Laws There are six types of Boolean Laws. AND law These laws use the AND operation. Therefore they are called as AND laws. Example: 1. A.0 = 0 1. A.1 = A 1. A.A = A 1. A.!A = 0 OR law These laws use the OR operation. Therefore they are called as OR laws. Example: 1. A+0 = A 2. A+1 = 1 3. A+A = A 4. A+!A = 1 INVERSION law This law uses the NOT operation. The inversion law states that double inversion of a variable results in the original variable itself. Example: !!A = A Commutative law Any binary operation which satisfies the following expression is referred to as commutative operation. Example: A.B = B.A A+B = B+A Associative law This law states that the order in which the logic operations are performed is irrelevant as their effect is the same. Example: (A.B).C = A.(B.C) (A+B)+C = A+(B+C) Distributive law Distributive law states the following condition. Example: A.(B+C) = A.B + A.C DeMorgan’s Theorem This theorem is useful in finding the complement of Boolean function. It states that the complement of logical OR of at least two Boolean variables is equal to the logical AND of each complemented variable. DeMorgan’s theorem with 2 Boolean variables x and y can be represented as (x + y)’ = x’.y’ The dual of the above Boolean function is (x.y)’ = x’ + y’ Therefore, the complement of logical AND of two Boolean variables is equal to the logical OR of each complemented variable. Similarly, we can apply DeMorgan’s theorem for more than 2 Boolean variables also. AND OR XOR NOT = Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

A Boolean Function is described by an algebraic expression called Boolean expression which consists of binary variables, the constants 0 and 1, and the logic operation symbols. Consider the following example. Example: F(A,B,C,D) = A + BC + !(ADC) Boolean Function Boolean expression Here the left side of the equation represents the output Y. So we can state Y = A + BC + !(ADC) Boolean Function Boolean expression Truth Table Formation A truth table represents a table having all combinations of inputs and their corresponding result. It is possible to convert the switching equation into a truth table. For example, consider the following switching equation. A B C F 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Sum of Product Expressions (SOP) Let’s consider a more complicated expression F(ABCD)= AB&#39;C+BD+CD+D and generate its truth table: F(AB’C+BD+CD+D) A B C D 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 This example was definately more involved than the previous expressions. An interesting observation is that we are doing a sum of product evaluation, that is, AB&#39;C+BD+CD+D is a sum of products. The significance of a sum of product is that when we are doing + we are in fact invoking the OR operator. Moreover, the OR operator returns true so long as any one of its arguements returns true. Therefore, if any of the terms in the sum of product (SOP) expressions is true, then we know that the final expression is true for certain. Example Algebraic Simplification Let’s simplify our expression from the previous truth table example. We can apply ordinary algebra tricks such as factoring. Remember that the + operator invokes the OR gate, and that true or x always returns true regardless of x (as shown in our first truth table). AB&#39;C+BD+CD+D // Initial expression AB&#39;C+BD+D(C+1) // Factor out a D AB&#39;C+BD+D // Since (C+1) is always true, as C OR true is always true AB&#39;C+D(B+1) // Factor out a D again AB&#39;C+D // Since (B+1) is always true, as B OR true is always true =AB&#39;C+D // Final expression As an exercise to the reader, complete the truth table to show that they are logically equivalent. Undefined Input &amp; Don’t Cares The definition of a “Don’t care” is a combination of input values that is not known, and could be either 0 or 1. For the purposes of variable simplification, we would choose the greedy approach of picking between {0, 1} such that the simplified expression has less terms. Let’s consider the following truth-table: F(AB) A B 1 0 0 1 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 We observe that we have a Don’t care. Let’s observe the differences in cases for F(1,0): Case #1: F(1, 0) = 0 =&gt; F(AB) = A&#39;B&#39; + A&#39;B + AB Case #2: F(1, 0) = 1 =&gt; F(AB) = A&#39;B&#39; + A&#39;B + AB&#39; + AB Simplifying the cases... F(AB) = A&#39;B&#39; + A&#39;B + AB = A&#39;(B&#39; + B) + AB = A&#39; + AB F(AB) = A&#39;B&#39; + A&#39;B + AB&#39; + AB = A&#39;(B&#39; + B) + A (B&#39; + B) = A&#39; + A = 1 We can clearly see, if we set F(1, 0) = 1, we get a true value for any input. Therefore, for the purposes of variable simplification, we can simply let F(1, 0) = 1 thus implying F(AB) = 1.

Clock signal Types of Triggering Level triggering Edge triggering Clock signal Clock signal is a periodic signal and its ON time and OFF time need not be the same. We can represent the clock signal as a square wave, when both its ON time and OFF time are same. This clock signal is shown in the following figure. n the above figure, square wave is considered as clock signal. This signal stays at logic High (5V) for some time and stays at logic Low (0V) for equal amount of time. This pattern repeats with some time period. In this case, the time period will be equal to either twice of ON time or twice of OFF time. We can represent the clock signal as train of pulses, when ON time and OFF time are not same. This clock signal is shown in the following figure. In the above figure, train of pulses is considered as clock signal. This signal stays at logic High (5V) for some time and stays at logic Low (0V) for some other time. This pattern repeats with some time period. In this case, the time period will be equal to sum of ON time and OFF time. The reciprocal of the time period of clock signal is known as the frequency of the clock signal. All sequential circuits are operated with clock signal. So, the frequency at which the sequential circuits can be operated accordingly the clock signal frequency has to be chosen. Types of Triggering Following are the two possible types of triggering that are used in sequential circuits. Level triggering Edge triggering Level triggering There are two levels, namely logic High and logic Low in clock signal. Following are the two types of level triggering. Positive level triggering Negative level triggering If the sequential circuit is operated with the clock signal when it is in Logic High, then that type of triggering is known as Positive level triggering. It is highlighted in below figure. If the sequential circuit is operated with the clock signal when it is in Logic Low, then that type of triggering is known as Negative level triggering. It is highlighted in the following figure. Edge triggering There are two types of transitions that occur in clock signal. That means, the clock signal transitions either from Logic Low to Logic High or Logic High to Logic Low. Following are the two types of edge triggering based on the transitions of clock signal. Positive edge triggering Negative edge triggering If the sequential circuit is operated with the clock signal that is transitioning from Logic Low to Logic High, then that type of triggering is known as Positive edge triggering. It is also called as rising edge triggering. It is shown in the following figure. If the sequential circuit is operated with the clock signal that is transitioning from Logic High to Logic Low, then that type of triggering is known as Negative edge triggering. It is also called as falling edge triggering. It is shown in the following figure. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

Since QA has changed from 0 to 1, it is treated as the positive clock edge by FF-B. There is no change in QB because FF-B is a negative edge triggered FF.QBQA = 01 after the first clock pulse. After 2nd negative clock edge On the arrival of second negative clock edge, FF-A toggles again and QA = 0.The change in QA acts as a negative clock edge for FF-B. So it will also toggle, and QB will be 1.QBQA = 10 after the second clock pulse. After 3rd negative clock edge On the arrival of 3rd negative clock edge, FF-A toggles again and QA become 1 from 0.Since this is a positive going change, FF-B does not respond to it and remains inactive. So QB does not change and continues to be equal to 1.QBQA = 11 after the third clock pulse. After 4th negative clock edge On the arrival of 4th negative clock edge, FF-A toggles again and QA becomes 1 from 0.This negative change in QA acts as clock pulse for FF-B. Hence it toggles to change QB from 1 to 0.QBQA = 00 after the fourth clock pulse. Truth Table Synchronous counters If the “clock” pulses are applied to all the flip-flops in a counter simultaneously, then such a counter is called as synchronous counter. 2-bit Synchronous up counter he JA and KA inputs of FF-A are tied to logic 1. So FF-A will work as a toggle flip-flop. The JB and KB inputs are connected to QA. Logical Diagram Operation Condition Operation Initially let both the FFs be in the reset state QBQA = 00 initially. After 1st negative clock edge As soon as the first negative clock edge is applied, FF-A will toggle and QA will change from 0 to 1.But at the instant of application of negative clock edge, QA , JB = KB = 0. Hence FF-B will not change its state. So QB will remain 0.QBQA = 01 after the first clock pulse. After 2nd negative clock edge On the arrival of second negative clock edge, FF-A toggles again and QA changes from 1 to 0.But at this instant QA was 1. So JB = KB= 1 and FF-B will toggle. Hence QB changes from 0 to 1.QBQA = 10 after the second clock pulse. After 3rd negative clock edge On application of the third falling clock edge, FF-A will toggle from 0 to 1 but there is no change of state for FF-B.QBQA = 11 after the third clock pulse. After 4th negative clock edge On application of the next clock pulse, QA will change from 1 to 0 as QB will also change from 1 to 0.QBQA = 00 after the fourth clock pulse.

So, this behavior of synchronous sequential circuits can be represented in the graphical form and it is known as state diagram. A synchronous sequential circuit is also called as Finite State Machine (FSM), if it has finite number of states. There are two types of FSMs. Mealy State Machine Moore State Machine Now, let us discuss about these two state machines one by one. Mealy State Machine A Finite State Machine is said to be Mealy state machine, if outputs depend on both present inputs &amp; present states. The block diagram of Mealy state machine is shown in the following figure. As shown in figure, there are two parts present in Mealy state machine. Those are combinational logic and memory. Memory is useful to provide some or part of previous outputs (present states) as inputs of combinational logic. So, based on the present inputs and present states, the Mealy state machine produces outputs. Therefore, the outputs will be valid only at positive (or negative) transition of the clock signal. The state diagram of Mealy state machine is shown in the following figure. In the above figure, there are three states, namely A, B &amp; C. These states are labelled inside the circles &amp; each circle corresponds to one state. Transitions between these states are represented with directed lines. Here, 0 / 0, 1 / 0 &amp; 1 / 1 denotes input / output. In the above figure, there are two transitions from each state based on the value of input, x. In general, the number of states required in Mealy state machine is less than or equal to the number of states required in Moore state machine. There is an equivalent Moore state machine for each Mealy state machine. Moore State Machine A Finite State Machine is said to be Moore state machine, if outputs depend only on present states. The block diagram of Moore state machine is shown in the following figure. As shown in figure, there are two parts present in Moore state machine. Those are combinational logic and memory. In this case, the present inputs and present states determine the next states. So, based on next states, Moore state machine produces the outputs. Therefore, the outputs will be valid only after transition of the state. The state diagram of Moore state machine is shown in the following figure. In the above figure, there are four states, namely A, B, C &amp; D. These states and the respective outputs are labelled inside the circles. Here, only the input value is labeled on each transition. In the above figure, there are two transitions from each state based on the value of input, x. In general, the number of states required in Moore state machine is more than or equal to the number of states required in Mealy state machine.

Moreover we have only 2 types of coins: 10¢ and 5¢. Our objective is to design a state machine that determines when to dispense a can, how to return the change. Note: in this design we will ignore the capacity of the stock, which means, we’ll assume that there will always be can in the vending machine. Also, we can assume that only one action could be made in every “clock cycle” or state RULES First give back the change then dispense the can. Understanding the possibilities There are quite few options: entering no money putting 5¢ followed by another 10¢ =&gt; getting the can putting 10¢ followed by 10¢ =&gt; receiving change =&gt; getting a can putting 5¢ followed by 5¢ followed by followed by 10¢=&gt; receiving change =&gt; getting a can putting 10¢ followed by 5¢ and getting the can putting 5$ followed by 5¢ followed by 5¢ =&gt; getting a can.

Latches Flip-flops Latches operate with enable signal, which is level sensitive. Whereas, flip-flops are edge sensitive. We will discuss about flip-flops in next module. Now, let us discuss about SR Latch &amp; D Latch one by one. SR Latch D Latch SR Latch SR Latch is also called as Set Reset Latch. This latch affects the outputs as long as the enable, E is maintained at ‘1’. The circuit diagram of SR Latch is shown in the following figure. This circuit has two inputs S &amp; R and two outputs Q(t) &amp; Q(t)’. The upper NOR gate has two inputs R &amp; complement of present state, Q(t)’ and produces next state, Q(t+1) when enable, E is ‘1’. Similarly, the lower NOR gate has two inputs S &amp; present state, Q(t) and produces complement of next state, Q(t+1)’ when enable, E is ‘1’. We know that a 2-input NOR gate produces an output, which is the complement of another input when one of the input is ‘0’. Similarly, it produces ‘0’ output, when one of the input is ‘1’. If S = 1, then next state Q(t + 1) will be equal to ‘1’ irrespective of present state, Q(t) values. If R = 1, then next state Q(t + 1) will be equal to ‘0’ irrespective of present state, Q(t) values. At any time, only of those two inputs should be ‘1’. If both inputs are ‘1’, then the next state Q(t + 1) value is undefined. The following table shows the state table of SR latch. S R Q(t+1) 0 0 Q(t) 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 - Therefore, SR Latch performs three types of functions such as Hold, Set &amp; Reset based on the input conditions. D Latch There is one drawback of SR Latch. That is the next state value can’t be predicted when both the inputs S &amp; R are one. So, we can overcome this difficulty by D Latch. It is also called as Data Latch. The circuit diagram of D Latch is shown in the following figure. This circuit has single input D and two outputs Q(t) &amp; Q(t)’. D Latch is obtained from SR Latch by placing an inverter between S amp;&amp; R inputs and connect D input to S. That means we eliminated the combinations of S &amp; R are of same value. If D = 0 → S = 0 &amp; R = 1, then next state Q(t + 1) will be equal to ‘0’ irrespective of present state, Q(t) values. This is corresponding to the second row of SR Latch state table. If D = 1 → S = 1 &amp; R = 0, then next state Q(t + 1) will be equal to ‘1’ irrespective of present state, Q(t) values. This is corresponding to the third row of SR Latch state table. The following table shows the state table of D latch. D Q(t + 1) 0 0 1 1 Therefore, D Latch Hold the information that is available on data input, D. That means the output of D Latch is sensitive to the changes in the input, D as long as the enable is High. In this module, we implemented various Latches by providing the cross coupling between NOR gates. Similarly, you can implement these Latches using NAND gates.

    "content": "K-Maps Introduction Enumeration and Gray Codes Simple Groupings Two Dimension Groupings Disjoint Groupings Overlapping Groupings Minimizing Group Count Introduction Karnaugh Maps are a way to visually display a boolean expression onto a 2D grid. We take the variables and bind them to an axis, and then enumerate through the possible combinations of input values that could occur for all those variables bounded to an axis (either horizontally or vertically). For example, we can display the following 2 variable Karnaugh Map: We have bounded to the vertical axis, the variable A, and we enumerate through the possible values for A (being {0, 1}). Similarily, we perform a similar operation for the B variable. Since we are using a 2 variable expression, we can bound one variable to each axis and the visualization works fine in a 2x2 matrix. Let’s instead look at a more involved example with 4 variables: We have now bounded the A and B variables to the vertical axis, while we bounded the C and D variables to the horizontal axis. We now enumarate through different combinations of the bounded variables for each axis in reflected binary code order (more on this in the following section). Lastly, we indicate on the matrix each true value by augmenting a 1 value. Enumeration and Gray Codes When enumerating through the variable input combinations for the binded axis, we take advantage of reflected binary code order, otherwise known as gray codes. If we observe carefully, we can notice that from one combination to another, we only vary by one bit. That is: ... 00 01 11 10 00 01 11 10 00 ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Thus, we get this wrapping that allows us to switch by only one bit. This provides us the core for how Karnaugh Maps work. Simple Groupings The main idea for how Karnaugh Maps can be used to simplify expressions is to group pairs of 1 values that are adjacent, and exploit the fact that each one has only a bit difference from another. For the purpose of this example, let F(ABCD) = CELL. We start with the expression F(0000) = 1 and F(0001) = 1. However, notice that regardless of the value of the last bit, we still get 1. Hence, let’s take a look at the SOP expressions: F(ABCD) = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D F(0000) = 1 F(0001) = 1 Since the last bit is the same, we can ignore the D value, thus: F(ABCD) = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39; We can confirm by simplifying algebraically: F(ABCD) = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;(D&#39; + D) = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39; Therefore, the simplification is true. We can then extend this rule to work for rectangles and more! Two Dimension Groupings Extending the idea of isolating changing bits that retain a consistent value, we can then generalize this to work in a higher dimension. Consider the following example: Letting F(ABCD) = CELL: F(0000) = 1 F(0001) = 1 F(0100) = 1 F(0101) = 1 Observe that the bits do not change by one for all pairs of numbers, for example {0000, 0101} differ by two bits. However, we can take advantage of the fact that for any bit change horizontally or vertically, it’s irrelvant what that bit is. More concretely, take a look at the following example. 0000 0001 0100 0101 =&gt; A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D + A&#39;BC&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;BC&#39;D Regardless of the B variable, we still get true for all products in the SOP expression. This is bounded vertically: =&gt; A&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;C&#39;D + A&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;C&#39;D Regardless of the D variable, we still get true for all products in the SOP expression. This is bounded horizontally: =&gt; A&#39;C&#39; + A&#39;C&#39; + A&#39;C&#39; + A&#39;C&#39; =&gt; A&#39;C&#39; (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) =&gt; A&#39;C&#39; (1) =&gt; A&#39;C&#39; Since the differences in bits needs to generalize throughout a binding of an axis, you can only have a binding of size 2^n for a given axis. For example, 1x1, 1x2, 1x4, 2x2, 2x4, 4x4. Disjoint Groupings Consider the following example: The algorithm follows precisely as it did before, except that now the two groups are joined in the SOP expression. Letting F(ABCD) = CELL: F(0000) = 1 F(0001) = 1 F(1111) = 1 F(1011) = 1 This yields the following: A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D + ABCD + AB&#39;CD Breaking down the expression: (A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D) + (ABCD + AB&#39;CD) =&gt; (A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;(D + D&#39;)) + (ACD(B + B&#39;)) =&gt; (A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;) + (ACD) =&gt; A&#39;B&#39;C&#39; + ACD Clearly this is the exact same process as before, but iterated throughout all the disjoint sets. Overlapping Groupings Overlapping groupings become more complex, because there exist ambigious cases and sometimes what may appear to be a locally optimal solutuion is not a globally optimal solution. The general technique for evaluating for overlapping groups follows a greedy algorithm. Define an unvisited cell as a cell that has a value of 1 however it is currently not matched with a grouping yet. Iterate through all the cells, and once you find a cell with 1, if it is unvisited then find the largest possible square or rectangle such that each side length is a power of 2, where all the cells are 1 in its enclosed area. If there is a tie for size (ie, 1x4 vs 2x2), assign the one that is a square (this is by convention). Repeat this process for all remaining unvisited cells. Note: You can overlap the groupings with already visited nodes, but you never instantiate a new grouping unless the current node is unvisited. In this example, at F(0000), we can create a grouping of size 2 (because 2 is the largest possible grouping, 3 is not a power of 2). We then iterate through to F(0001), however F(0001) was already resolved to a grouping. For the latest active cell, F(0011) is not resolved to a grouping thus it’s unvisited. The largest possible grouping is also of size 2, thus we create another group. To resolve the groupings into an SOP expression, we iterate through the groups and identify changing bits: Group #1 =&gt; F(ABCD) = [0000, 0001] Group #2 =&gt; F(ABCD) = [0001, 0011] For Group #1: 0000 0001 ^ ^ F(ABCD) = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D&#39; + A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D =&gt; A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;(D + D&#39;) =&gt; A&#39;B&#39;C&#39; For Group #2: 0001 0011 ^ ^ F(ABCD) = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39;D + A&#39;B&#39;CD =&gt; A&#39;B&#39;D(C&#39; + C) =&gt; A&#39;B&#39;D Now we add the two results: F(ABCD) = A&#39;B&#39;C&#39; + A&#39;B&#39;D =&gt; F(ABCD) = A&#39;B&#39;D + A&#39;B&#39;C&#39; (by commutative property) Minimizing Group Count The following example will ilustrate how the greedy approach may occasionally produce too many groups. Consider the following example: This grouping state is optimal. However, consider adding a 1 to F(1111). Following the previous algorithm, iterating top-bottom and left-right, when getting to F(0110), the algorithm can choose to make the largest grouping. However, there are two possible groupings: Candidate #1: F(ABCD) = [0011, 0010, 0111, 0110] Candidate #2: F(ABCD) = [0111, 0110, 1111, 1110] Both groupings have the same size, and are the same dimension. However, upon reaching F(1110), another grouping needs to be instantiated, in which case if the first candidate grouping was created then we made a group that was not neccessary increasing the size of our SOP expression. This illustrates the idea that this is a greedy algorithm, and does not always return the most simplified SOP expression. In later sections, algorithms illustrating a globally optimal algorithm will be discussed. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",

Shift mode When the shift/load bar line is low (1), the AND gate 2, 4 and 6 become inactive. Hence the parallel loading of the data becomes impossible. But the AND gate 1,3 and 5 become active. Therefore the shifting of data from left to right bit by bit on application of clock pulses. Thus the parallel in serial out operation takes place. Block Diagram",

But sequential circuit has memory so output can vary based on input. This type of circuits uses previous input, output, clock and a memory element. This sequential circuit contains a set of inputs and output(s). The output(s) of sequential circuit depends not only on the combination of present inputs but also on the previous output(s). Previous output is nothing but the present state. Therefore, sequential circuits contain combinational circuits along with memory (storage) elements. Some sequential circuits may not contain combinational circuits, but only memory elements. Following table shows the differences between combinational circuits and sequential circuits.

That means, all the outputs of asynchronous sequential circuits do not change (affect) at the same time. Therefore, most of the outputs of asynchronous sequential circuits are not in synchronous with either only positive edges or only negative edges of clock signal. Synchronous sequential circuits If all the outputs of a sequential circuit change (affect) with respect to active transition of clock signal, then that sequential circuit is called as Synchronous sequential circuit. That means, all the outputs of synchronous sequential circuits change (affect) at the same time.
